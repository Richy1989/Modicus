## A nanoframework Sensor Data Collector for MQTT
### Build for the ESP32 Hardware

Welcome to the official GitHub page for our Tasmota-inspired C# application designed to gather sensor data and seamlessly transmit it to an MQTT broker. This project empowers you to easily monitor and manage various sensors while ensuring smooth integration with MQTT-based systems.

## Features

- Read all kinds of sensors with the help of the powerful nanoframework
- Control the application via MQTT

## Note
- Not even an alpha version yet
- This is a very new application, it can read only one sensor as of now (BME280). 
- This software is in active development and will grow
- Contribution is happily Welcome
